// Datatypes: Primitive and Reference Types.

//Reference types: Data is stored in Heap and are accessed by refference/Pointer to the location in memory.

// List of primitive data types

    //String

    //Number (INt, Decimal and Floats are considered as same type <Number>)

    //Boolean

    //Null (Intentional Empty Value)

    //Undefined (Declared only not having any value.)

    //Symbols (ES6)

// List of Reference Data Types/Objects

    //Arrays

// Javascript is Dynamically Typed Language
    // Unlike Statically typed languages
    // Datatypes are associated with Values and not Variables.
        // Same variable can hold multiple types.

    // There are supersets of JS and addons for static typing (TYpeScript, Flow)
